          My name is Pants Weevil, because I am a pants weevil. And that's weevil, not weasel. I get really pissed off when someone calls me a pants weasel. That's something else altogether. When I get pissed off, I bite, so watch it, okay? Monkey boy said I was his best friend which is really funny because he's always trying to squish me. But one thing about us parasites: if you have parasites you're never alone in the world. And if you're a parasite yourself, you're never alone in the world, either. Of course, that's a mixed blessing. When your lifelong companion is Monkey boy, being alone might be a more attractive option.<br />
          I never met my Mom. She laid her eggs on Monkey boy and then disappeared. Maybe his Mom ate her. My siblings have wandered off to more attractive hosts, but Monkey boy suits me okay. He's lots of fun, actually.<br />
    Like, it's fun to crawl into his ear and whisper stuff to him. Like, "Is it still there?" Whenever I do that, he feels his crotch. It's an old joke with us pants weevils.

    <p class="hidden" id="desc-six">A 43-year-old woman is undergoing surgery after two rocks that she collected at a South County beach ignited in the pocket of her shorts, officials from Orange County Fire Authority said.<br />
    The incident happened about 3:30 p.m. Saturday when the woman was standing in her kitchen after returning from an outing to Trestles Beach. She had been home for about an hour when the pocket of her cargo shorts caught fire, OCFA Capt. Marc Stone said.</p>
